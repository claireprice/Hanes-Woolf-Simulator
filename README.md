# Hanes-Woolf Simulator

An interactive, browser-based visualisation tool to explore the **Hanes-Woolf plot** in enzyme kinetics. Allows users to adjust kinetic parameters and observe real-time changes to the linearised equation.

## Features

- Dynamic plot of [S]/v vs [S]
- Adjustable parameters: **Vmax** and **Km**
- Visual feedback on slope and y-intercept
- Annotation of kinetic significance
- Built-in quiz to test understanding
- Theme toggle (light/dark)

## How to Use

1. Use the sliders to change **Vmax** and **Km**.
2. Observe changes in slope and intercept.
3. Use the quiz to check your understanding of the Hanes-Woolf plot.
4. Toggle between dark and light theme as needed.
